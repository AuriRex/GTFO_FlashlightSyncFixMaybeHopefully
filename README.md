# FlashlightSyncFixMaybeHopefully

Should hopefully fix some of the flashlight syncing issues, maybe.

> [!NOTE]  
> One thing to note is that this should only make your own flashlights sync properly to other players,  
> **so this most likely will not help if you're hosting and a client does not have it installed**
